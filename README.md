# PCA
Kernel â€“PCA.  PCA will always detect all structure in a given data set, because of linearity. By using suitable nonlinear features, we can extract more information. Vapnik Chervonenkis theory tells us that often mappings our data into a higher dimensional space than the dimension of the input space provide us with greater classification power and the data could become more easily separated.
